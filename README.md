# Tech Design: Basketball Player App

## Components Breakdown
- `App` component: Renders the main page of the application.
- `HomePage` component: Displays the player list, search bar, and color picker.
- `Player` component: Displays individual player information and a button to mark as a favorite.

## Services
- Axios: Used to make HTTP requests to the external API.

## Interaction Flow

1. When the app loads, the `App` component renders the `HomePage` component.
2. The `HomePage` component fetches player data from the external API and displays it in a list.
3. Users can search for players using the search bar, which triggers the `handleSearch` function to filter the displayed players.
4. Users can mark players as favorites by clicking the "+" or "-" icon. This invokes the `setFavorite` function and updates the player's favorite status.
5. The color picker allows users to change the background color of the right section of the page.
6. Users can load more players by clicking the "Load More" button, which fetches the next page of player data.
7. The app handles loading states and error messages appropriately.
